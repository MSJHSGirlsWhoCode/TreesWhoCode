<h2>Our Story ðŸŒº</h2>
      <p>

				Hi! Welcome to the homepage for our Impact Project!
			</p>
			<p>
				Because technology is advancing faster and farther than even, the population is increasing at an exponential rate. Sadly, along with it, the air quality is declining as well. Entire forests are being decimated in the attempt to create homes for our fellow humans. With air pollution accumalting in our atmostphere, the need for greenery is greater than ever. A question I'm sure we all have is "How can we help?"
			</p>
      <p>
        We are students in Girls Who Code working to create a website to make it easier for you to plant... well, plants. Our website is aimed to help you save our earth one plant at a time! We are working to create a catalog so you can find a plant easy for you to grow and love. Set goals for yourself and have fun planting! ðŸŒº
